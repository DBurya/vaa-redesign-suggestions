您是否贊成提高學齡前兒童（0至6歲）之相關補助或津貼？日前各黨總統初選，有論者拋出「0至6歲國家養」等政策，現況下針對家中有學齡前兒童（0-6歲）之家庭，已有相關育兒津貼、托育、就學等補助，是否需要更全面的扶養補貼，乃是值得大眾討論的議題。由國家提升補助費用或範圍，有機會提高生育率，減輕少子化的壓力與問題。現況下我國財政負擔已經很重，若要調高對於兒童之補助，勢必要調高稅率，此時將造成民眾負擔，反倒傷害整體經濟發展。,"Do you support increasing subsidies or allowances for preschoolers (0-6 years old)?

您是否贊成增加國防預算？依據 2019 年中國政府工作報告，中國國防預算金額為人民幣 1 兆 1898.76 億元（約新台 幣 5.47 兆元）；我國 108 年度中央政府總預算，今年度國防預算為 3404.78 億元，兩岸差距約 16 倍。軍事是促進 和平的手段，面對兩岸軍力失衡，我國應增加國防預算，促進國防自主化及添購軍事設備。臺灣小國寡民，不適合與中 國進行軍備競賽，軍事預算應確保達成自主防衛即可，節省下的預算分配在教育或社會支出。,"Increasing of the national defense budget: do you support it?

您是否贊成總統提名行政院長應經過立法院同意？1997 年修憲，憲法增修條文規定行政院長的產生方式由總統直接提 名，不需經由立法院同意。立法院從此喪失閣揆同意權，無法對於行政院長任命過程產生影響。總統任命行政院長未經 立法院同意，會使行政院長成為總統的幕僚長，無法落實憲法給予行政院長的權力，而造成行政院長有責無權的現象。 如需經立法院同意才任命行政院長，會相當程度干擾總統實踐其競選政見。總統既為民選首長，直接任命行政院長可確 保行政體系運作較有效率。,"Do you agree that the President should nominate the Chief Executive with the consent of the Legislature?
