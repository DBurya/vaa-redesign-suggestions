# vaa-redesign-suggestions
This repository presents the results of the research conducted in June 2021 - December 2021.

In the process of statement selection for voting advice applications (VAA), political scientists spend a considerable amount of time analyzing the domestic and foreign policies of a given country. While there is a large amount of government open data available to the public, analyzing these data manually is impractical. In order to facilitate such time-consuming and labor-intensive work, the authors propose a system to assist VAA designers and developers in re-designing statements. Using advanced language modeling and text summarization techniques on the VAA data and a politics-related corpus, the system produces suggestions that would be applicable for revising the original VAA statements. Experiments conducted on Taiwanese VAA and e-petition data show that the system can generate valuable suggestions for VAA designers and could serve as an additional tool for VAA development.
